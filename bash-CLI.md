# Bash CLI tricks

## Keyboard shortcuts

You can find complete lists of Bash shortcuts elsewhere. I only write down those I'm trying to learn...

| Shortcut | Task                                                         |
| :---     | :---                                                         |
| `Ctrl-O` | Execute current line from history, on return gives next line |
| `Ctrl-U` | Delete from cursor to beginning of line                      |
| `Meta-*` | Insert all possible command line completions                 |
